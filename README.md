<h1>Hallo!üëã</h1>

<p>Welcome again to this beautiful journey of learning how to code with Alx. The contents of this whole repository include my journey with the Frontend ALX program. This specific project is unique and is aimed towards improving my coding skills. I will highlight the objectives and requirements below, Enjoy ü§ì</p>

<h1>Project Scope:</h1>
<h2>The website will consist of five core webpages:</h2>
<p>
Homepage (index.html): This is the landing page that introduces TechCon 2024 and provides navigation to other sections of the website.</p>
<p>
About Page (about.html): This page delves into the history, mission, and notable speakers of the TechCon conference.</p>

<p>
Schedule Page (schedule.html): This webpage presents a detailed schedule of conference events, sessions, and speakers in an accessible table format.</p>

<p>
Register Page (register.html): This page offers a user-friendly registration form for attendees to sign up for the TechCon conference.</p>

<p>
Contact Page (contact.html): This webpage provides comprehensive contact information for TechCon, including email address, social media links, an embedded map, and a ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù form.</p>

<h1>
Concepts Covered:</h1>
<h2>Throughout this project, you‚Äôll gain practical experience with the following HTML concepts:</h2>

<p>HTML Structure: You‚Äôll solidify your understanding of fundamental HTML tags like header, nav, main, section, article, footer, and their proper usage for website structure and organization.</p>

<p>Headings and Text: You‚Äôll learn to structure headings (h1-h6) for emphasis and utilize paragraph tags (p) and other text formatting elements effectively.</p>

<p>
Links and Navigation: You‚Äôll implement hyperlinks (a tags) to create navigation menus and link between different webpages within the TechCon website.</p>

<p>
Tables: You‚Äôll create a well-formatted table on the Schedule page to present conference schedules in an organized and easy-to-read manner.</p>

<p>
Forms: You‚Äôll design user-friendly registration and contact forms using the form tag and various input types (text, email, password, checkbox) to collect attendee information.</p>

<p>
Images and Multimedia: You‚Äôll incorporate images (using img tags with appropriate alt attributes) to enhance the visual appeal of the website. You‚Äôll also explore embedding a promotional video (using the video tag) and an interactive Google Map (using iframe) on the Contact page.
</p>


<p>
By successfully completing this project, you‚Äôll gain valuable hands-on experience building a real-world website with HTML. This will serve as a solid foundation for you to explore more advanced web development concepts like CSS and JavaScript in the future.
